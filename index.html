                    <p>This project is a quick social commerce platform that enables users of Zalo to purchase various
                        products. We have numerous merchants on our platform, including BigC, KFC, HLC, and more. These
                        merchants have migrated their data, including product items, categories, and store information,
                        onto our platform. Users have the flexibility to choose from multiple payment options, such as
                        ZaloPay, cash on delivery (COD), or our secure payment gateways</p>

                    <p>I develop UI/UX based on designs and product architecture documents (PAD). Additionally, I
                        migrate products to micro-frontends with Webpack's Module Federation PluginZ and integrate them into Zalo mini apps. I handle various
                        tasks such as synchronizing data with the data platform, sending notifications to users through
                        Zalo Notification Service, utilizing Kafka for order creation, implementing cron jobs for
                        pushing file data to merchants, and managing data migration with partners like BigC and
                        Heineken. Additionally, I am proficient in writing unit tests for both frontend and backend
                        components to ensure robustness and quality.</p>

By leveraging Moodle, we developed a system that allowed students to register their faces, enabling automated attendance during classes without the need for manual intervention by teachers. The project involved extensive data collection to create datasets, followed by model training using AI algorithms to detect students' faces accurately. Additionally, a server and a Moodle module were built to implement the face detection feature seamlessly.</li>
